# python-security-tools

This repository contains Python scripts focused on basic security tasks and automation. These tools are created for learning purposes and to build a foundation in Python for cybersecurity.

🛠️ Tools Included:

•Port Scanner
A simple tool to scan open ports on a target host using the socket library.
•Password Generator
A script that generates secure, random passwords based on user-defined criteria.
•Hashing Tool
A utility to hash strings using common algorithms (MD5, SHA-256, etc.).
•Basic Brute-Force Tool
A Python script for educational purposes to understand brute-force attacks (use only in legal, controlled environments).

⚙️ Setup & Usage:
Prerequisites:
•Python 3.x
•Required libraries:
•socket (for port scanner)
•hashlib (for hashing tools)
You can install dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Example Usage:

1.Port Scanner:
python port_scanner.py --target <IP> --ports 80,443,22

2.Password Generator:
python password_generator.py --length 16
📚 Future Enhancements:
Add more advanced security tools
Explore other security concepts like network sniffing, data exfiltration, etc.
Integrate with AI/ML techniques for more intelligent security tools
